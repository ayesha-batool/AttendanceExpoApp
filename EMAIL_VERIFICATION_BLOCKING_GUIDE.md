# üîí Email Verification Blocking System

## üìã **Overview**

4. User cannot access dashboard until email is verified

### **2. Login Flow**
1. User logs in with email and password
2. System checks email verification status
3. If email is not verified ‚Üí Redirect to verification required page
4. If email is verified ‚Üí Redirect to dashboard

### **3. Verification Flow**
1. User clicks verification link in email
2. Verification page processes userId and secret
3. User data is refreshed to update verification status
4. User is automatically redirected to dashboard
